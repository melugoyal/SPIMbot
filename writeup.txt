1. What optimizations did you implement?

We implemented private apples and targeted our snake to head for the closest apple between the 
public apple and most recently created private apple. We also handled the bonk interrupt by turning
right. The bonk interrupt handling is not ideal, but is better than no resolution strategy at all.

2. Please explain for each of your partners what their main
contributions were (e.g., strategy, implementation of which
components, testing/debugging, etc.)

Duc Hieu Pham: Choosing the correct target for the snake to follow

David Toh: Bonk interrupt handling, various testing, write up

Mehul Goyal: Creation of private apples 

3. Please describe how your team decided to split up the tasks.

Naturally, this competition has many different aspects that are somewhat independent of each other 
(solving the puzzle for a private apple and managing bonk interrupts for example). At the beginning
we brainstormed the various things that needed doing and split the tasks into what seemed to be 3 
equal workloads and then eached picked a group of tasks to manage.

4. Describe a teamwork challenge that your team had and how you resolved it.

It was difficult to find a way to work on the same code together. We all have access to our own svn
repositories but lacked a shared space to combine all our materials. We ended up using git/github
so that we could all work on the problem at the same time and see each others work.
